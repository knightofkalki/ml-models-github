# ML Models Repository

Welcome to the **ML Models Repository**! This repository contains two machine learning models developed for distinct tasks: emotion detection from images and real-time palm-based attribute prediction.

- **Model 1**: Analyzes input images to classify emotions as "Happy" or "Sad".
- **Model 2**: Processes real-time palm input to predict 5 distinct attributes.

## **Overview**
This repository hosts two machine learning models designed for unique applications:
- **Model 1** takes an image as input and predicts whether the depicted emotion is "Happy" or "Sad".
- **Model 2** operates in real-time, analyzing palm gestures or features to output 5 specific attributes (e.g., gesture types, hand orientation, or other palm-related characteristics).

Both models are implemented in Python and leverage popular machine learning frameworks for ease of use and scalability.

## **Model Descriptions**

### Model 1: Emotion Detection
- **Input**: An image (e.g., facial image in formats like JPG, PNG).
- **Output**: Binary classification - "Happy" or "Sad".
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications like sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, or interactive media.
- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or similar image classification model (assumed based on image input).
- **Training Data**: Trained on a dataset of labeled facial images (not included in the repo for privacy reasons).

### Model 2: Palm Attribute Prediction
- **Input**: Real-time palm input, typically captured via a camera or sensor (e.g., webcam feed).
- **Output**: 5 distinct attributes (e.g., finger count, palm orientation, gesture type, or other hand-specific features).
- **Use Case**: Ideal for gesture recognition, human-computer interaction, or augmented reality applications.
- **Model Type**: Real-time computer vision model, possibly using LSTM or transformer-based architectures for sequential data (assumed based on real-time processing).
- **Processing**: Designed to handle live video streams or sensor data with low latency.

## **Installation**
To set up the repository and run the models, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
